# Delhivery_data_analysis
**Introduction:**  
Delhivery is the largest and fastest-growing fully integrated player in India by revenue in Fiscal 2021. They aim to build the operating system for commerce, through a combination of worldclass infrastructure, logistics operations of the highest quality, and cutting-edge engineering and technology capabilities.
The Data team builds intelligence and capabilities using this data that helps them to widen the gap between the quality, efficiency, and profitability of their business versus their competitors.

**The Problem Statement**  
•
The company wants to understand and process the data coming out of data engineering pipelines:  
•
Clean, sanitize and manipulate data to get useful features out of raw fields  
•
Make sense out of the raw data and help the data science team to build forecasting models onit.  

**Conclusion**  
**1-Limited Timeframe**

The dataset spans only two months, which restricts the ability to draw conclusions about seasonal trends or long-term patterns such as month-over-month or year-over-year changes.

**2-Data Discrepancy in Time Metrics**

A notable difference between actual_time and segment_actual_time_sum suggests inconsistencies in data entry or logging practices.


**3-Inconsistency in Predicted Time**
A significant difference between segment_osrm_time_sum and osrm_time points to potential inaccuracies in the ML model’s time estimations.

**4-Top Performing States**

The five states contributing the most business are: Maharashtra, Karnataka, Haryana, Tamil Nadu, and Telangana.

**5-Top Performing Cities**

The leading cities in terms of order volume are: Bengaluru, Mumbai, Gurgaon, Delhi, and Hyderabad.

**6-Peak Order Day**

The highest number of orders are placed on Wednesdays, indicating a mid-week surge in demand.

**#✅ Recommendations**

**Enhance ML Model Accuracy**

Invest in refining the machine learning model to improve predictions related to time and distance, thereby boosting operational efficiency.

**Focus on High-Performing Regions**

Prioritize infrastructure development and carrier enablement in top-performing states and cities to capitalize on existing demand and drive growth.

**Optimize Mid-Week Operations**

Prepare for increased order volumes on Wednesdays by scheduling extended shifts and deploying additional workforce to meet demand effectively.
